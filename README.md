# Cybersecurity Defender in 4 Weeks
Course Setup for the "Title: Cybersecurity Defender in 4 Weeks: Think Like an Attacker - Breach Prevention and Detection" live training by Omar Santos.

## About the course
In the world of cybersecurity, you must know both how threat actors attack their victims and how to defend against such attacks. You have to learn to think like an attacker. Take your Threat Hunting and Incident Response skills to the next level with this intensive, hands-on class with Omar Santos. This live and interactive training is designed to help you understand todayâ€™s advanced threats, monitor your network, perform incident response, and threat hunting, and learn different adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). You will gain hands-on experience monitoring, responding to, and remediating internal threats (also known as active defense).
This four-day training  provides hands-on and real-world incident response exercises covering topics such as threat intelligence, threat hunting, orchestration, automation, security monitoring, and incident response methodologies. Learn how to use the most current and useful tools available, including Security Onion, Suricata, Zeek (formerly known as Bro), Fleet, HUNT, osquery, TheHive, Elasticsearch, logstash, and Kibana (ELK), Caldera, Atomic Red Team, Metasploit, Maltego, Yeti, and many others. You will learn how these tools can be used in combination with the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to perform threat hunting and adversarial simulation or emulation. This training is also a great way to gain the extra insight needed to help pass a number of certifications, including CISSP, CompTIA Security+, CompTIA CySA+, CompTIA CASP+, GSEC, GNFA, GCTI, Cisco's CyberOps Associate and CyberOps Professional.

Cybersecurity Defender in 4 Weeks is your inside track for learning how red and blue teams not only work, but strategically coordinate the best methods for breach detection and prevention. 
Find out how cybersecurity red teams mimic an adversary and assess the overall security of your network, while also examining how blue teams defend your organizations against threat actors and their attacks. You will also build the skills necessary to create and work in blue and red teams, while also exploring the concept of "purple teams" or "purple teaming" which combines the elements of defense and offense within an organization.
